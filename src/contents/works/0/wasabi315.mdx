I created my website. I will use this website to share my works, what I've learned, and what I'm currently working on.

## Technology Used

This website is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.
The experience with Gatsby was great as many useful Gatsby plugins are available so I could create this website with ease.
I used SCSS for styling and did not use any other CSS framework. I learned a lot about CSS and SCSS through building this website.
Source codes and contents of this website are on GitHub.

## Could you help me improve this website and my English skill?:man-bowing:

I'm Japanese and learning English. This website is also a place for me to practice my writing skills in English.
Therefore you may find broken English on this website. If you notice it, please open an issue on GitHub.
**`View this article on GitHub`** links at the bottom of the article pages would be convenient for you to do that.
