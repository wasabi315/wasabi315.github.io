I will use this website to share my works, what I've learned, and what I'm currently working on.

## Technology Used

This website is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.
The experience with Gatsby was great as many useful Gatsby plugins are available so I could create this website with ease.
I used SCSS for styling and did not use any other CSS framework. I learned a lot about CSS and SCSS by building this website.
Source codes and contents of this website are on GitHub.

## Could you help me improve this website and my English skills?:man-bowing:

I'm Japanese and learning English. This website is also a place for me to practice my writing skills in English.
Therefore you may find broken English on this website. If you notice it, please let me know. Comment fields at the bottom of the article pages would be convenient for you to do that.
