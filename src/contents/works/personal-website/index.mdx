I created my personal website. I'm going to use this website to share my works, what I've learned, and what I'm currently working on.

## Technology Used
This website is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.
I do not use any CMS for managing contents of this website and store them on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wasabi315/wasabi315.github.io).

## Could you help me improve this website and my English skill?
I'm a Japanese and learning English. This website is also a place for me to practice my writing skills in English.
Therefore you may find some language errors in this website. If you find them, please let me know.
